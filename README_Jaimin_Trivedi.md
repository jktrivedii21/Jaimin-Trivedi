Hi! I'm a **Business Intelligence Analyst** from Kentucky, specializing in business analytics, data visualization, and storytelling. Iâ€™m proficient in tools like SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, with a passion for leveraging data to solve complex business problems and drive performance improvements.

Currently, I serve as **General Manager** at **Quality Inn and Suites**, where I lead operations for a hotel generating $1.2M in annual revenue. I have also successfully implemented data-driven solutions to optimize costs, increasing revenue by 15%. My expertise extends across operations, financial analysis, and developing performance dashboards.

In 2024, I completed the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program**, a five-month intensive course that covered essential BI skills, including data cleaning, SQL, business analytics, and data storytelling with Tableau. The program, coupled with my hands-on experience in hospitality management, has significantly enhanced my skills in driving data-driven business decisions.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly expanding my knowledge in BIA, focusing on SQL, Tableau, and data storytelling to deliver even more impactful insights.
